# `figures`

The [`figures`](https://github.com/fmilisav/milisav_dyadic_communication/tree/main/figures) folder contains the plots 
generated by the main [`analysis.py`](https://github.com/fmilisav/milisav_dyadic_communication/blob/main/code/analysis/analysis.py) script and constituting the figures of the manuscript.  
Plots are organized by analysis type. Most plots pertain to the original dataset (1000 nodes - *Discovery* dataset - weighted).  
Filenames of plots derived from the sensitivity datasets always contain the following flags for identification:

- `125` or `500`: refer to the 219 or 1000 cortical nodes resolutions of the Cammoun atlas, respectively;
- `discov` or `valid`: refer to the *Discovery* or *Validation* datasets, respectively;
- `bin` or `wei`: refer to results derived from the binary or weighted structural consensus networks, respectively.

If a filename does not contain these flags, it relates to the original dataset.

Additionally, some results are further organized/characterized by the following flags:

- `rand` or `geo_rand`: refer to results derived using a strength sequence-preserving or a geometry-preserving randomization procedure, respectively.
- `all` or `poly`: refer to results obtained by taking into account all or only polysynaptic communication pathways, respectively.

Furthermore, density plots of spin null distributions complement the spin test results presented in the paper and `.txt` files detail certain quantitative results.
